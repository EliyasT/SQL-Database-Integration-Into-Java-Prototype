# SQL Database Integration Into Java Prototype

This repository contains a Java prototype for a Student Information System that has been enhanced by integrating a SQL database and implementing new functionalities.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to integrate a SQL database into the existing Java prototype and implement queries to retrieve student data and attempts supervised by professors. Additionally, modifications were made to display supervisor details in the Java program.

## Key Features

- **Integration of SQL Database**: The Java prototype was enhanced by integrating a SQL database, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Database Queries Implementation**: Queries were implemented to retrieve student data and attempts supervised by professors. Two main queries, "getAllStudents" and "getAttemptsForStudents," were developed to serve these purposes.

- **Database Schema Update**: The ER-Diagram and relational schema were updated to accommodate professors' inclusion in the system. This involved defining new relationships and attributes to reflect the changes accurately.

- **Java Program Modification**: The Java program was updated to display supervisor details in the attempts window. This involved modifying multiple classes related to the "Attempt" entity.

## Project Development

1. **Database Integration**: JDBC documentation was referenced to establish a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database.

2. **Query Implementation**: Queries were designed and implemented to retrieve student data and attempts supervised by professors.

3. **Schema Update**: The ER-Diagram and relational schema were updated to reflect the changes in the system's structure.

4. **Java Program Modification**: Changes were made to the Java program to display supervisor details in the attempts window.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Meticulous testing was conducted throughout the development process to ensure the system's functionality and accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project successfully integrated a SQL database into the Java prototype, implemented database queries, and modified the Java program to display supervisor details. These enhancements have significantly improved the Student Information System's capabilities and laid the foundation for further development in the future.
